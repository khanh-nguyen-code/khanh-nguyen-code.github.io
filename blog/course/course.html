        <h1>My favorite courses</h1>

        <p>
        <h2>NTU.CE1007.Data_Structures</h2>
        basic C programming, recursion, memory management, array, linked list, stack and queue, binary tree, binary tree traversal, graph
        <br>
        <small><i>
            this course uses the continuous assessment that is a series of interview-like tests. The worst thing is I performed badly on all of them not due to my lack of understanding the concepts but my poor C programming skills. (That triggered me later, now C++ is my most fluent programming language)

        <p>
        <h2>NTU.CZ2001.Algorithms</h2>
        analysis of algorithms, search: sequential search, binary search, hashing, sort: insertion sort, heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, graph: breath first search, depth first search, backtracking, dijkstra, minimum spanning tree,
        <br>
        <small><i>
            this course is pretty easy but I got only A-. this is probably the only course requires me "thinking" other than maths courses in year 1.

        <h2>NTU.CZ3005.Artificial_Intelligence</h2>
        @article{russell2002artificial, title = {Artificial intelligence: a modern approach}, author = {Russell, Stuart and Norvig, Peter}, year = {2002}}
        <br>
        search: uninformed search (breath first search, depth first search, iterative deepening depth first search, uniform cost search), informed search (best first, A*), heuristic function, constraint satisfaction problem, adversarial search (minimax), first order logic,
        <br>
        <small><i>
            first half of this course is quite straight forward. the second half is not that clear. the prof in second half style of teaching is a bit weird (try not to use bad words here). I have not learn much in the second half except Prolog. Prolog is a programming language solving the logic problem using search techniques. Oh, almost forgot. In the lecture of minimax, we were using an online platform to ask lecturer (Prof Shafiq Joty) questions about the content. I asked anonymously whether we can consider minimax as branch and bound (bnb was the home-learning content for the last lecture). He said that the person who asked this question was kind of very smart (I've played that part of the video lecture record multiple times). I remained anonymous until now.

        <br>
        <small><i>
            hard course, really hard course (I got A+). this course introduces many concepts regarding model of computation (regular expression, finite automata, context-free grammar, pushdown automata) that is really cool especially for a algo guy like me.

        <h2>NTU.CZ4015.Simulation_and_Modelling</h2>
        @book{banks2013discrete, title={Discrete-event system simulation: Pearson new international edition}, author={Banks, Jerry and Carson, John S and Nelson, Barry L and Nicol, David M}, year={2013}, publisher={Pearson Higher Ed}}

            this course is very very engineering and fun to learn. after all, simulation is a computational method to estimate some distribution. (well, machine learning)

        <br>
        <small><i>
            other than NTU.CZ2001.Algorithms, this is the second course gives the "taste of algorithms" (lecturer Prof Zinovi Rabinovich), courses in year 1 2 3 in CS NTU are very boring actually, there is nothing chalenging really. It is not that surprise I've got A+ for this (even though I did badly on 2/4 quizzes that sem).

        <br>
        <small><i>
            this course is quite heavy comparing to other courses in year 1 2 3. I've got a bad grade on this even though I managed to understand and prove all equations by myself. I would say, final exams in NTU are all bs. A course like machine learning has the final that tests student on how to perform these algorithms with open-book? (literally similar to primary school test) Why don't just let us prove them by ourselves in the exam in test our understanding?

        <small><i>
            beside NTU.CZ3007.Compiler_Techniques, the course is very cool. For an algo guy like me, this course is an easy A course (I got A- btw). Here is an interesting story. At the end of lecture 13 (the last lecture), I went out of the class and waited for lecturer (Prof Sun Aixin) just to meet him and thank him for the most interesting lecturing throughout my 4 years at NTU. (I voted for him for the Nanyang Teaching Award)

        <br>
        <small><i>
            I enrolled this course because of my FYP topic: "Cluster Analysis on Dynamic Graphs" (@article{nguyen2020cluster, title={Cluster analysis on dynamic graphs}, author={Nguyen, Ngoc Khanh}, year={2020}, publisher={Nanyang Technological University}}). The content is quite interesting, the quiz is hard enough. I've got about top 3 in the only quiz in a class of 100 people. But two ** projects gave me B+ :) The first project has 4 people and me is the only person who did all the work on data analysis. (one other did UI) The second one has 8 people and also me is the only person who read the paper, wrote code, did experiment and write up on the report (two others did the introduction). Sad enough!
