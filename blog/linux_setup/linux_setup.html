        <h1>How I install an application on Linux</h1>
        <h2>First Rule</h2>
        NEVER MESS WITH THE DEFAULT PACKAGE MANAGER. IT IS USED TO WORK WITH THE OPERATING SYSTEM ONLY!

        <h2>GUI Application</h2>
        (1) Find a distribution on <b>flathub</b> or <b>AppImageHub</b> and you are done.
        <br>
        (2) If the previous steps does not work. Try with <b>linuxbrew</b>, download the binaries or build the application from source.
        <br>
        (3) Create a <b>.desktop</b> file and put it in <b>~/.local/share/applications/</b> to create a GNOME application launcher.

        <h2>CLI Application</h2>
        (1) Try with <b>linuxbrew</b>, download the binaries or build the application from source.
        <br>
        (2) Edit <b>PATH</b> in <b>~/.bashrc</b> to access the binaries globally.
