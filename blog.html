        <h1>My unordered thoughts</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><i>
                It seems like I prefer reals than integers
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                Is P = NP?
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                Does evolutionary computation have any advance beyond other randomized algorithm implementation?
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                Duality Gap is interesting. What makes hard problems hard?
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                Can we classify NP problems into distinct hardness sets such that each of the sets has its own algorithm to solve?
                <br>
                e.g: P problems, crypto problems, P-complete problems, etc.
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                1-norm has a better capability to extract the sparse solutions.
                <br>
                Is there any complexity class corresponding to 1-norm? (of course &lt;1-norm is not convex)
                <br>
                How about atomic norm?
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                I've read about how adding number of neurons equals to the number of outputs makes all the bad local optimal vanish.
                <br>
                So cool! gonna read about this seriously
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                another research is about the connection between implicit regularization (initialize weights to be near zero) and rank minimization.
                <br>
                another cool topic to read
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                my next textbook to self teach is "Abstract Algebra - Dummit"
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                should I do an applied math master, computer science master or pure math master?
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                is there a library or programming language that automatically deals with algebra manipulation?
                <br>
                the rule of algebra game is already discrete.
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                the adjacency matrix of a very large graph can be consider as a function from [0, 1] x [0, 1] to [0, 1]
                <br>
                the eigenvalues become a monotone function
                <br>
                the normalized eigenvectors can be thought as a curve in the unit sphere in countably infinite dimensional vector space.
            </i></li>
            <li><i>
                If step-by-step of the derivation is correct, there is absolutely no way the answer is incorrect.
            </i></li>
